
Dear Asst Trainers,

I am aware i still have a couple outstanding. Recently I have been prioritising the
mini project 1. Rest assured they will delivered as soon as I breather.

If i can successfully survive the project, Im sure that my late labs will not
be so difficult anymore. Thanks much for your pateience. I will of course accept the late penalties incurred.
